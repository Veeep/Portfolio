                <p>I am a <strong>practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine</strong> that is currently practicing in <a href="http://www.tumwaterchirocenter.com">Tumwater, WA.</a></p> 
                <p>I am the <strong>IT supervisor</strong> of annual<a href="http://www.botanicalmedicine.com"> botanical medicine conferences.</a></p>
                <p>I am originally from southern Illinois, but have been in the <em>glorious</em> PNW since 2010.</p>
                <p>I bought mt first home in southern Illinois in 2008, and taught myself how to completely renovate it into a rental property.</p>
                <p>I am a huge nature lover and have always been apprehensive of having a career in tech since I didn't want to end up spending too much time in front of a computer inside.</p>
                <p>But after seeing a modern coding open-office studio in Portland that had a beautiful view, plenty of sunshine and dogs running around happily, I realized that my aptitude for technology and interest with coding didn't mean I would have to be working in a <em>dark cave</em> to do my job!</p>
